A FastAPI based application that allows for generating text using an LLM (large language model) using the [Exllamav2 backend](https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2)

TabbyAPI is also the official API backend server for ExllamaV2.

## Disclaimer

This project is marked as rolling release. There may be bugs and changes down the line. Please be aware that you might need to reinstall dependencies if needed.

TabbyAPI is a hobby project made for a small amount of users. It is not meant to run on production servers. For that, please look at other solutions that support those workloads.

## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
>  This README does not have instructions for setting up. Please read the Wiki.

Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI/wiki/1.-Getting-Started) for more information. It contains user-facing documentation for installation, configuration, sampling, API usage, and so much more.

## Features

- OpenAI compatible API
- Loading/unloading models
- HuggingFace model downloading
- Embedding model support
- JSON schema + Regex + EBNF support
- AI Horde support
- Speculative decoding via draft models
- Multi-lora with independent scaling (ex. a weight of 0.9)
- Inbuilt proxy to override client request parameters/samplers
- Flexible Jinja2 template engine for chat completions that conforms to HuggingFace
- Concurrent inference with asyncio
- Utilizes modern python paradigms
- Continuous batching engine using paged attention
- Fast classifer-free guidance

And much more. If something is missing here, PR it in!

## Supported Model Types

TabbyAPI uses Exllamav2 as a powerful and fast backend for model inference, loading, etc. Therefore, the following types of models are supported:

- Exl2 (Highly recommended)

- GPTQ

- FP16 (using Exllamav2's loader)

In addition, TabbyAPI supports parallel batching using paged attention for Nvidia Ampere GPUs and higher.
