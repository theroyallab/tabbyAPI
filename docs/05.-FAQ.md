## FAQ
- What OS is supported?
  - Windows and Linux

- I'm confused, how do I do anything with this API?
  - That's okay! Not everyone is an AI mastermind on their first try. The start scripts and `config.yml` aim to guide new users to the right configuration. The [Usage](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI/wiki/03.-Usage) page explains how the API works. [Community Projects](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI/wiki/09.-Community-Projects) contain UIs that help interact with TabbyAPI via API endpoints. The [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sYQxnuD7Fj) is also a place to ask questions, but please be nice.

- How do I interface with the API?
  - The wiki is meant for user-facing documentation. Devs are recommended to use the autogenerated documentation for [OpenAI](https://theroyallab.github.io/tabbyAPI) and [Kobold](https://theroyallab.github.io/tabbyAPI/kobold) servers

- What does TabbyAPI run?
  - TabbyAPI uses Exllamav2 as a powerful and fast backend for model inference, loading, etc. Therefore, the following types of models are supported:
    - Exl2 (Highly recommended)
    - GPTQ
    - FP16 (using Exllamav2's loader)

- Exllamav2 may error with the following exception: `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing exllamav2_ext: The specified module could not be found.`
  - First, make sure to check if the wheel is equivalent to your python version and CUDA version. Also make sure you're in a venv or conda environment.
  - If those prerequisites are correct, the torch cache may need to be cleared. This is due to a mismatching exllamav2_ext.
    - In Windows: Find the cache at `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\torch_extensions\torch_extensions\Cache` where `<User>` is your Windows username
    - In Linux: Find the cache at `~/.cache/torch_extensions`
    - look for any folder named `exllamav2_ext` in the python subdirectories and delete them.
    - Restart TabbyAPI and launching should work again.
