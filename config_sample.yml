# Sample YAML file for configuration.
# Comment and uncomment values as needed. Every value has a default within the application.
# This file serves to be a drop in for config.yml

# Unless specified in the comments, DO NOT put these options in quotes!
# You can use https://www.yamllint.com/ if you want to check your YAML formatting.

network:
  # The IP to host on (default: 127.0.0.1).

  host: 127.0.0.1

  # The port to host on (default: 5000)

  # Number of experts to use PER TOKEN. Fetched from the model's config.json if not specified (default: Empty)
